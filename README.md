## Overview
FOIATrackr automates the end-to-end lifecycle of FOIA-style requests by orchestrating UiPath bots through a web-accessible governance interface. The platform standardizes request intake, assigns unique tracking identifiers, continuously monitors deadlines, and escalates cases approaching or exceeding statutory timelines.

The solution is designed to complement existing case management systems by automating repetitive tracking and reporting tasks while maintaining full traceability and audit readiness required in federal environments.
